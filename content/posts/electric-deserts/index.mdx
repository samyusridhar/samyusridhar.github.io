Listening to the earnest twang of Tuareg guitarist
[Bombino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombino_(musician))’s instrument, one might hear what sounds
like the familiar blues through a sun-soaked, defiantly liberated lens. His music is reminiscent of
a variety of influential tunes from Jimi Hendrix’s “Little Wing” to Stevie Ray Vaughn’s “Lenny” to
Ali Farka Touré’s “Dofana”; although the rebellious motivations of both musical movements are
shared, it is incorrect to assume that Tuareg guitar practice is a direct descendant of American
blues. Bombino’s lyrics, rhythms, and melodies prove that the guitar is simply an extension of the
musician by infusing the guitar strings with the spirit of the Sahara desert in a manner unique to
the voice of his people; he and all of the Tuareg rebel-musicians before him force us to look past
the exotic haze created by Western “global” music culture, and deeply appreciate the full and very
real weight of the revolution within.

The vastly diverse and semi-nomadic
[Tuareg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuareg_people#:~:text=The%20Tuareg%20people%20), or *kel
Tamasheq*, population of the Sahara-Sahel region have a turbulent history. They are called *Amajagh*
and *Tamajaq*, meaning “free men and women” in Arabic, as indicated by their uncommon and
unregulated heritage built upon decentralized coexisting confederations, lucrative caravan trade,
cooperation amongst social strata, and matrilineal traditions. The Tuareg had to begin fighting for
their way of life as the end of the 19th century saw a French colonial invasion of their homelands,
and their fight continued through the political unrest incited by displacement and competition for
resources amongst northern states in the aftermath of African independence in the 1960’s. In the
turbulent post-independence landscape, the unbounded population suddenly found themselves split into
five African states (Mali, Niger, Libya, Algeria, and Burkina Faso), with varying degrees of
inclusion; Libya and Algeria enforced full assimilation while Mali and Niger excluded the Tuareg
from postcolonial reform policies. African leadership began to reimagine what it meant to be
African, and the nomadic and ethnically diverse Tuareg didn't necessary fit into that new identity.
In either direction, the regimes sought to wield their newfound power to diminish the existence of
the *kel Tamasheq*. These decades of turmoil unique to the economically and socially marginalized
Tuareg gave rise to a new evolution of unlikely warriors amongst them: musicians.

Music and political unrest flourished in tandem within the Tuareg community throughout the 1900’s,
often uniting to fight the common enemy of cultural extinction. During this period of the West’s
increasing encroachment upon global popular culture, Tuareg music adapted, while remaining strongly
steeped in its heritage. It evolved from the more traditional *teherdent* style to *tishumaren*, or
the music of *ishumar* (taken from the French word *chômeur* meaning “unemployed”), with the
introduction of the guitar. The community-based *teherdent* style features a three string lute
called a *teherdent* (the style’s namesake), accompanied by both male and female voices and
scattered rhythmic intervals of the *tinde* drum and clapping, usually performed at intimate local
events by repeating symbolic lore of heroic Tuareg warriors, nature, and love amongst familiar and
supportive faces. Music was often ceremonial and musicians revered at such events, and it is
quintessentially entwined with Tuareg identity, as it holds the stories of their past.

As the Malian government took over northern Africa in the 1960’s, the peacefully coexisting factions
of *kel Tamasheq* unified into a larger national identity out of necessity. Several people either
did not want or were denied citizenship in neighboring countries, and now found themselves working
unstable seasonal jobs, hence the name *ishumar*; several men were recruited to fight for Libyan
dictator Muammar al-Gaddafi in 1980, where they received military training and exposure to political
separatist ideas. This shared experience led *ishumar* to begin providing support for each other
outside of their own tribal confederations, creating a transnational network that began to seed
Tuareg separatist rebel groups, such as MNLA (National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad).
Within this context of fundamental changes to their way of life, some *ishumar* started to
incorporate the more recognizable and accessible guitar into their long-standing tradition of
musical expression, symbolically linking it to their fight for the preservation of their identity.
This newly created network allowed illegal *ishumar* guitar recordings, forbidden by the government
for their political messages and unifying power, to circulate via cassette tape, and the scattered
Tuareg communities were able to hear reflections of their own experiences voiced for the first time.
Though the instrument changed from the *teherdent* to the guitar, the power of community held in
both traditional and modernized Tuareg music did not change; in fact, the *ishumar* guitar became an
even more crucial instrument of storytelling as the fight against the dissolution of Tuareg identity
became more urgent.

After the Tuareg were effectively forced in the pursuit of survival to abandon their nomadic
community subsistence in favor of a conformation to an economically-defined "productivity", they
were pushed into the metaphorical and literal margins of their new states when several of them chose
not to comply. A mass migration throughout the 80’s and 90’s catalyzed by economic and political
exclusion, continued violence, and several unforgiving droughts had the diaspora congregating in
large shantytowns on the borders of Algeria, Mali, and Niger, creating informal refugee communities.
It is within these communities that *ishumar* guitar started to rise in popularity alongside the
emerging Tuareg rebellion. Largely at the forefront of the bootleg ishumar cassette trade was the
band [Tinariwen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinariwen), which would go on to become the most
iconic voice of the Tuareg, and a [rallying point for the disenfranchised
nation](https://www.allmusic.com/artist/tinariwen-mn0000603621/biography). In his early childhood,
founder of Tinariwen and Malian refugee Ibrahim Ag Alhabib fashioned his first guitar out of a
plastic water can, incorporating Arabic pop and rock tunes into the familiar rhythms and notes of
traditional music. In 1979, he formed the first iteration of Tinariwen with other musicians in the
rebel community, inspired by the virtuosity (not Americanness) of rock legends like Led Zeppelin and
Jimi Hendrix, but writing and recording music very purposefully and specifically about the struggle
of the Tuareg people. Their lyrics would hold political messages and it became a means of spreading
information about the state of the rebellion. Tinariwen’s members were perhaps the most famous
example of “[military
artists](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/rebel-music-the-tuareg-uprising-in-12-songs-by-tinariwen)"
in the rebellions, using both music and weapons to fight for the preservation of Tuareg culture.
They were active participants in several insurrections, and they recorded those experiences through
their music, energizing and calling to action a generation of fighters.

**The Symbolic Power of a Familiar Song**<br />
A familiar melody is more than a beautiful tune and a comforting rhythm is more than a groovy beat;
both are immediate reminders of why a song is familiar and comfortable in the first place, why it is
special. A melody tied to identity can inspire a litany of emotions, such as nostalgia, joy, or
pride, and the sudden accessibility of familiar Tuareg melodies by huge groups of disenfranchised
people pushed together served as a reminder of a stolen lifestyle; musical events and performances
not only brought the Tuareg into shared physical spaces, just as they used to do in their old way of
life, but also into newly shared emotional spaces as the musical milieu imbibed the feelings of
frustration and righteous anger emerging from the rebellion. In one particular way, the beat of
Tuareg songs are meant to mirror the drawling gait of a camel, one of the most familiar and
comforting rhythms to the nomadic tradespeople and a reminder of the years of theirs and their
ancestors’ lives navigating their beloved Sahara. The displaced communities drew upon their shared
emotional connection to their music to build upon a preexisting pride in their heritage, and this
pride became crucial to the nationalist sentiment of rebel groups and the idea that the Tuareg
deserved a national identity of their own. Their music serves as a reminder of loss, and what was
done to their people, creating a stronger sense of unity and belonging than they previously had as a
nomadic tribal population. This unity is the exact opposite of what the Malian government was trying
to achieve, and it stoked the flames of many uprisings. 

**Coded Messaging**<br />
In the absence of a central infrastructure, *tishumaren* worked as a newspaper, carrying lyrical
messages of current events from a Tuareg perspective to the fractured population. Oftentimes in
*Tamasheq*, the language of the Tuareg, the lyrics were like private coded messages, only
disseminated and understood by their own. This function of *tishumaren* as a vehicle for ideas and
values was adapted from traditional Tuareg music, which was often used to prescribe a penal code, or
sing praises of a valued member of the tribe, along with memorializing Tuareg lore. The role of
music in Tuareg society stayed the same, but the messages themselves evolved as the needs of the
community changed. The lyricism in *tishumaren* closely reflected the separatist rhetoric that
groups like the MNLA were employing as a reasoning for the necessity of a Tuareg state. The MNLA
adopted humanitarian and indigenous rights philosophies in the later rebellions, and these
philosophies can be found in popular lyrics such as in Tinariwen’s “Soixante Trois”, brazenly named
in French (the language of their original colonizers), which solemnly states:

> *’63 has gone, but will return*<br />
> *Those days have left their traces*<br />
> *They murdered the old folk and a child just born*<br />
> *They swooped down to the pastures and wiped out the cattle…*<br />
> *’63 has gone, but will return*<br />

Based on Tinariwen’s own Ibrahim Ag Alhabib’s experience witnessing his father’s execution at the
age of 4, these lyrics evoke stark imagery of the brutality and injustice of colonialism, and
support the MNLA’s plea for humane rights with personal and relatable examples of inhumane
treatment. There is a warning within the lyrics that it is inevitable. The lyrics ring with pathos,
encapsulating very real experiences that provide an invaluable oral record of the plight of the
Tuareg and serve the imperative function of raising awareness. *Tishumaren* lyrics also urged Tuareg
people to band together, such as in Tinarewen’s “Toumast”:

> *A divided people will never reach its goal*<br />
> *It will never cultivate an acacia tree with beautiful leaves*<br />
> *A divided people will lose its way*<br />
> *Each part of it will become an enemy in itself*<br />

Sometimes, without explicitly discussing Tuareg tragedy, *tishumaren* lyrics bring to light the
complex joys of being kel Tamasheq, with words like those in Bombino’s “Tenere”, where he sings
about the beautiful harshness of his home:

> *I am realizing the hard conditions of the life of my brothers*<br />
> *Sun is burning in the desert. There is no rain in the desert*<br />
> *To live in the desert, we need to have a strong morale*<br />
> *We live in the most beautiful space and the hardest space for life*<br />
> *Wide open spaces of the desert! In the desert! Desert! In the desert!*<br />

The Tuareg crisis is a modern example of the dangers of unwarranted and unnecessary interference in
another way of life, of imperialism. When resources are exhausted and fighters outnumbered, there is
a quieter resistance in simply continuing to live. Empowered by *tishumaren*, the Tuareg youth began
to perfect and love the art, and to freely express their thoughts on the Tuareg condition through
music amidst tremendous hardship. Among those youths was Bombino, who took his talents and message
around the world, widely memorializing the story of the Tuareg in a way very similar to the
messaging in traditional Tuareg music, repeating lore of Tuareg greatness in the face of adversity.
Also at the forefront of Tuareg fame is the all-female band Les Filles de Illighadad, founded by
Fatou Seidi Ghali, who is believed to be the first Tuareg women to play guitar professionally; she
transformed the traditional role of the female musician which centered around the *tinde* drum, and
dared to learn to play the guitar. With the *tinde* being a source of inspiration for *tishumaren*,
Ghali and her bandmates are [asserting the power of women to innovate using the roots of traditional
Tuareg music](https://www.loc.gov/concerts/folklife/fillesdeillighadad.html), and in the process,
staying true to Tuareg matriarchal roots. This unwavering adaptability proves that the Tuareg
identity remains resilient through colonization, urbanization, displacement, and oppression, and
that violence alone cannot extinguish a people if their culture lives on. Not for the first or last
time in history, violence and art work in tandem to resist the oppression of a minority.
