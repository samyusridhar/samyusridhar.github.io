##### [My Soundtrack](/projects/my-soundtrack.pdf)
###### *January 2021*
>Music is very important to me and plays a large role in my life, so I decided to combine my two
>worlds and use predictive modeling in Python to analyze my music tastes and create a recommendation
>system based on my favorite tracks.
>
>I curated a training data set by reading the audio features for all the songs in my Spotify library;
>I marked all of my favorite songs with a "1", and the rest with a "0". The test data set consisted
>of songs from three Spotify playlists that I regularly listen to. After exploring the data further,
>I decided to use a random forest model to output the likelihood for each track in the test data that
>I would add that track to my favorites.

>Read about the full process in my [blog](../electric-deserts).

##### [Titanic Survival Predictions](/projects/titanic-survival-predictions.pdf)
###### *December 2020*
>About a week ago, I took an online Python for Machine Learning course through General Assembly.
>Through that class, we were tasked with creating a set of predictions for the survival of passengers
>aboard the Titanic. The original challenge was posted on Kaggle: we were given a training data set
>with the actual survival data of passengers, and a test set without survival data for which we had
>to provide the predictions. This allowed me to use the supervised learning classification models
>K-Nearest Neighbors and Random Forest to output a set of predictions for data that I cleaned first. 
>
>**My model scored a 73% accuracy.**

##### [2016 Presidential Election Analysis](/projects/2016-presidential-election-analysis.pdf)
###### *March 2018*
>The culmination of the Data Mining class I took at UCSB was an exploratory statistical analysis of
>the 2016 presidential election in the statistical programming language R. 
>
>   1. Cleaned voting data by removing N/A values, sorting into federal/state/county levels, and ensuring consistency
>   2. Plotted the voting data on a U.S. county map to visualize which counties voted for which candidate, in order to determine what to further investigate
>   3. Inspected county voting outcomes on the basis of average poverty, to observe whether there was a significant difference in poverty levels between Trump and Clinton voters
>   4. Ran PCA, random forest, and clustering to determine the most influential factors on 2016 voting results.
