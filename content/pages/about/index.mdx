I am a documentary filmmaker based in New York City.

Through creative storytelling and empathetic reporting, I aspire to explore the depth and the beauty of our diverse human existence.

With the aim of opening minds and urging people to identify with the world around them, I hope to challenge my own beliefs in the process.

I am currently pursuing a graduate degree in News & Documentary Journalism at New York University.
